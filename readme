Create a simple PHP hash service.
/hash has 2 implementations
• Store: data is provided with POST request in JSON body structure: {“data”: “…”}, in response we expect to get SHA1 code of data provided - {“hash”: “…”} • Read: read data by provided hash in URL (hash/[HASCODE]) in response we can have the following results:
• If nothing was found - a 404 error
• If we have 1 result - {“item”: “…”}
• If we have collisions add collisions array - {“item”: “…”, “collisions”: [“…”, “…”]}
The preferred PHP framework is Symfony or Laravel
As storage files or regular DB can be used:
• in case of DB migration that creates a structure must be committed
Service must have
• Data validation - field data is required
• Tests that cover common logic
• We should check for collisions - in case we already have data in DB with the same hash additional message about it should be added to the response.
mv
The result could be a private git (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) repository to
alex.datsko@devotedstudios.com or via ZIP archive.
Also good to have a time report just like a comment.
